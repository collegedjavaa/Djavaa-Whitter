        <h1>Hello! I'm Djavaa Whitter.</h1>
        <h2>My first name is pronounced 'shuh-vay'. The 'D' is silent.</h2>
        
        <p>I recently graduated from Brooklyn College (May 2020) with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I was initially a Computer Science major but then I realized that I was more interested in the creative and soft-coding side of programming. This doesn't mean I don't have knowledge of different programming techniques! I'm always willing to learn more as well!</p>
        
        <p>This website is currently a work in progress!</p>
